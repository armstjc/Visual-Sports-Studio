# Visual-Sports-Studio
This project aims to design a desktop application that can retrieve sports stats from multiple sport leagues, and then give the user a toolbox of features like graphing and data exporting for users with little to no programing abilities. In order to achieve this end goal, the intention is to use data and software from open-source sports data projects to provide the data to users and then use open-source graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks to give users a low-code application that they can then manipulate the data with and have a codebase that can be easily ported to multiple platforms. With a core framework and design framework, I hope that this app, codenamed "Visual Sports Studio", can help those who want to work with various sports stats but don't have an extensive technical background.
