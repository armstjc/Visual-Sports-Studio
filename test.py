"""
    DESIGN PATTERN - Multithreaded Long Tasks GUI
    Presents one method for running long-running operations in a PySimpleGUI environment.
    The PySimpleGUI code, and thus the underlying GUI framework, runs as the primary, main thread
    The "long work" is contained in the thread that is being started.
    July 2020 - Note that this program has been updated to use the new Window.write_event_value method.
    This method has not yet been ported to the other PySimpleGUI ports and is thus limited to the tkinter ports for now.
    
    Internally to PySimpleGUI, a queue.Queue is used by the threads to communicate with main GUI code
    The PySimpleGUI code is structured just like a typical PySimpleGUI program.  A layout defined,
        a Window is created, and an event loop is executed.
    This design pattern works for all of the flavors of PySimpleGUI including the Web and also repl.it
    You'll find a repl.it version here: https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Async-With-Queue-Communicationspy
